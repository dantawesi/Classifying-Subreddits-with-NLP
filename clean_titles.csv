9,AskMen,"how can you distinguish between a lazy partner and someone who just doesn't care about you? i just got out of a relationship and am reflecting on where i may have gone wrong in terms of being more communicative about my expectations, and am wondering if my boyfriend is just a lazy guy or if he didn't really care about me. 

you hear a lot of jokes about inattentive husbands who just genuinely don't think about romance. my dad is like this with my mom but i have no doubt that he loves her and sometimes when she complains about not going on dates or not ever getting surprises from him, he's genuinely shocked. 

but then i also see a lot recently about how men will change for who they want to, so if you notice a lack of effort in a partner, it's probably because he doesn't love you. 

i find this hard to reconcile because i know for a fact that my ex was a lazy dude (due to his nature and a struggle with depression) in all aspects of life, so it's not inconceivable that that just naturally extended into our relationship irrespective of how he felt about me. it's not hard to believe that a guy who won't do his laundry and doesn't go above the minimum at his job would also not set up a romantic date night.

i'm just curious if some people really are lazy in relationships because that's how they are or if we can always gauge someone's love for you by their effort. do you guys feel when you're being a bit lazy in a relationship and does that reflect something about your nature or rather your interest in the relationship?",how can you distinguish between a lazy partner and someone who just do not care about you i just get out of a relationship and be reflect on where i may have go wrong in term of be much communicative about my expectation and be wonder if my boyfriend be just a lazy guy or if he do not really care about me you hear a lot of joke about inattentive husband who just genuinely do not think about romance my dad be like this with my mom but i have no doubt that he love her and sometimes when she complain about not go on date or not ever get surprise from him -PRON- have genuinely shock but then i also see a lot recently about how man will change for who they want to so if you notice a lack of effort in a partner -PRON- have probably because he do not love you i find this hard to reconcile because i know for a fact that my ex be a lazy dude due to his nature and a struggle with depression in all aspect of life so -PRON- have not inconceivable that that just naturally extend into our relationship irrespective of how he feel about me -PRON- have not hard to believe that a guy who will not do his laundry and do not go above the minimum at his job would also not set up a romantic date night -PRON- be just curious if some people really be lazy in relationship because that have how they be or if we can always gauge someone have love for you by their effort do you guy feel when -PRON- be be a bite lazy in a relationship and doe that reflect something about your nature or rather your interest in the relationship,0

54,AskMen,"how do you deal with the aftermath of an emotionally abusive relationship? apologies if this is not the appropriate place to post a question like this, or if this triggers anyone.

so i was wondering if anyone here had good advice for dealing with the aftermath of an emotionally abusive relationship?

it ended a couple of months ago but i still get really awful feelings (slight nerves, feeling embarrassed or upset, a weird feeling that is kinda like needing to throw up, sometimes showing up in dreams, some other stuff too) every once in a while whenever something reminds me of her. i also do not miss her and would never get back with her. i have unfriended her on everything.

background:
i was in a 2 year relationship that ended almost 4 months ago. start of the relationship was great but the last 6 months of it were really bad. we also lived together for 1 year. i am an immigrant to my ex-gf's native country.

the abuse was minor to moderate and never escalated to full on physical abuse. examples include:
-&gt; never giving me any affection, compliments, etc. and rejecting all of my advances 
-&gt; never wanting to do any of my date ideas and only hers
-&gt; organizing her own things and telling me that i wouldn't be interested so to not bother going with her
-&gt; being pretty distant and grumpy at home and way more upbeat when we did do something together with her friends
-&gt; talking about her sexual experiences with her previous partners in public whilst nothing was going on between us (even after i told her how this upset me. of course it was my fault for being upset...)

85,AskMen,"under what situations would you prefer the girl to keep her clothes on during sex? tl;dr - assuming that most guys prefer the girl to be at least partially undressed during sex, under what situations would you prefer that the girl keeps her clothes on, in a casual fwb relationship?

context:

i (f27, indian) have been casually seeing a guy (m27, white)  for the past month. we meet at either his place or mine, have pleasant small talk, have sex, and cuddle multiple times a week . things have been great so far, except that the guy prefers that i keep my clothes on during sex (apart from removing what needs to be removed), and i'm slightly uncomfortable with it. he is agnostic towards his own clothes, and i strongly prefer not having clothes on. it is such an intimate thing after all. it is unusual for me as all guys i've been with like the girl to at least be partially undressed.

the reason it bothers me is because a previous guy i dated wanted to call it off with me because i wasn't ""petite"" enough for him (i'm 5'5"", 140 pounds). before that, i was very comfortable in my skin, i believed i looked sexy when i wanted to, and was overall satisfied with my body and my sex life. but the previous guy's comments has made me a little less secure about my body. i know that every person has their own preference, and i'm neither judging the previous guy for wanting to be with petite women, or feeling that i'm completely worthless, but it does make me question whether this guy also doesn't want to see me naked because he thinks i'm unattractive. i haven't asked him yet if it is just me, or he generally has a preference for clothes-on with other women as well. it can't be hygiene issues as i shower, put lotion and dress nice everytime i meet him. if the reason is that he doesn't find my body attractive, i'd rather call it off than be with someone who'd only want to have sex with me with clothes on. hence the question.",under what situation would you prefer the girl to keep her clothe on during sex tl dr assume that much guy prefer the girl to be at little partially undress during sex under what situation would you prefer that the girl keep her clothe on in a casual fwb relationship context i f27 indian have be casually see a guy m27 white for the past month we meet at either his place or mine have pleasant small talk have sex and cuddle multiple time a week thing have be great so far except that the guy prefer that i keep my clothe on during sex apart from remove what need to be remove and -PRON- be slightly uncomfortable with it he be agnostic towards his own clothe and i strongly prefer not have clothe on it be such a intimate thing after all it be unusual for me a all guy -PRON- have be with like the girl to at little be partially undress the reason it bother me be because a previous guy i date want to call it off with me because i be not petite enough for him -PRON- be 5'5 140 pound before that i be very comfortable in my skin i believe i look sexy when i want to and be overall satisfy with my body and my sex life but the previous guy have comment have make me a little little secure about my body i know that every person have their own preference and -PRON- be neither judge the previous guy for want to be with petite woman or feel that -PRON- be completely worthless but it doe make me question whether this guy also do not want to see me naked because he think -PRON- be unattractive i have not ask him yet if it be just me or he generally have a preference for clothe on with other woman a good it can not be hygiene issue a i shower put lotion and dress nice everytime i meet him if the reason be that he do not find my body attractive -PRON- would rather call it off than be with someone who would only want to have sex with me with clothe on hence the question,0

87,AskMen,"how do you guys act in real life social situations after you've looked at some weird fetish porn? you don't feel dirty or guilty? so, this may be a weird question but please hear me out. so, i used to be a pretty heavy porn user back in college, like, 10 years ago.

most of it was normal porn but some of it was slightly weird, like, sometimes i would watch those “super heroine gets defeated and fu\*\*ed” videos...

anyway, i was generally able to carry on with life as normal and passed college, and was still a very normal person in my real life, had lots of friends, but still slightly introverted.

i’m 30 now, and about 5 years ago, i discovered the nofap and noporn communities, and started reading about all the “damaging” effects of porn use, such as causing social anxiety, lack of confidence, etc.

after reading all the success stories from reformed porn users i got really excited and totally cut porn out of my life, and minimised fapping to once or twice a month.

i honestly did start noticing myself becoming more confident, assertive and outgoing, and naturally being more drawn to real life girls. holding eye contact became a lot easier.

now, 5 years later i’m still using porn as infrequently as possible, but occasionally i will “relapse” and binge on it for a few hours. this happens maybe once every 4 months or so.

whenever it happens, i really beat myself up, i think mostly because people on those subreddits say that it causes social anxiety/low self esteem to come back.

i just “relapsed” for the first time in 2019 yesterday (yes i went 10 months without porn), and now i’m terrified that when i go into my sales job on monday that i’ll be really bad at it, since it requires one to be super outgoing, charming and assertive.

clearly, i’m not addicted to porn use, and can easily go months without using it. but the people on the noporn subs have convinced me that it takes a couple of weeks of no porn to get the “superpowers” back.

it has to be placebo, as lots of my friends look at porn all the time and then just go about their lives as usual, and lots of them are very loud and confident, “life of the party” types.

i guess i’m looking for some reassurance here that occasional porn use isn’t a bad thing, and that everyone has their kind of weird little fetishes, and that it doesn’t matter as long as you don’t carry them into real life. (i’ve had girlfriends and my sex life with them is totally normal, never wanted to do any weird stuff)

for the past few years, every time i relapse i purposely try to avoid parties, social events, etc for 2 weeks or so, until the “superpowers” gained from abstaining come back.

nothing really excites me anymore. i feel like i'm doing my job just for the sake of it (and not very well at that). likewise for the course i'm studying, i genuinely think i'm gonna hate this career but i'm only doing it cause if i tried something else, i'd hate it even more. and believe me, i've put some thought into it and can't think of anything else that would suit me. in terms of hobbies - movies, books, video games and all that stuff no longer interests me. i have about ten movies on netflix all at the 20 minute mark cause i just can't hold my attention long enough to watch any more of them. whenever i try something new i never follow up on it, and it just ends in failure.

the only thing that i think could make my life worthwhile is finding a girlfriend, but that's not gonna happen, mainly cause i have no meaningful life to speak of and would probably get clingy very quickly. so for the other guys out there, what have you done when you feel like you're just being alive without really *living*?",what to do when you have no passion for life so -PRON- be in my early 20s and while i get that much people my age do not exactly have everything figure out i feel like they at little have something to which they can look forward nothing really excite me anymore i feel like -PRON- be do my job just for the sake of it and not very good at that likewise for the course -PRON- be study i genuinely think -PRON- be go to hate this career but -PRON- be only do it cause if i try something else -PRON- would hate it even much and believe me -PRON- have put some think into it and can not think of anything else that would suit me in term of hobby movie book video game and all that stuff no long interest me i have about ten movie on netflix all at the 20 minute mark cause i just can not hold my attention long enough to watch any much of them whenever i try something new i never follow up on it and it just end in failure the only thing that i think can make my life worthwhile be find a girlfriend but that have not go to happen mainly cause i have no meaningful life to speak of and would probably get clingy very quickly so for the other guy out there what have you do when you feel like -PRON- be just be alive without really live,0

184,AskMen,"how do i reclaim my emotions? i want to find a happy medium of managing them rather than stifling them at every turn. i've recently started to notice that reacting to emotions no longer comes so easily to me as it did when i was younger.

anger, sadness, resent,  feeling loved, or reacting at all to any sort of emotional situation: by default, i kind of sense it and analyze it, judge how to appropriately 'appear' to respond to it, and proceed accordingly. this is rather opposite from what i think is normal: simply 'feeling' the emotion letting it happen, and taking ownership of what happens afterward.

i am afraid that if i lose the ability to identify with my own emotions; or ""be true"" to them i will lose any chance of truly connecting with another human being; whether they be a friend, family member, potential life partner or whatever type of relationship requires 'true emotions/feelings/normal reactions' to be real/true/healthy.

231,AskMen,"men of reddit, what is your most memorable moment of falling in love with someone? i’m 22 years old and i’ve been in two serious relationships in my lifetime. the first relationship i was in was with a girl who i dated for six months in the same city, and nine months across the world. she moved to australia with her entire family and we both wanted to try to make it work since we were both young (18/19) and naive enough to think it would have worked out. i was in love with her but understood the complications of being in a relationship like that. after i hadnt physically been with her for 8 months, i travelled to australia and spent a month with her and her family. when i returned back to the good ol’ great white north, the pressure of the long distance relationship began to set in and 2 weeks after i got back i pulled the trigger and ended our relationship. it may seem harsh but it was the best option for both of us since she was going to university down there and i was working and trying to save money so i could go to school. we broke up 3 years ago and i spent 2 of those years trying to get over her. i moved to a different city 6 hours away from my hometown trying to reset and get a fresh start on life.

i haven’t been with another girl since i moved away, i was single for 2.5 years trying to get myself back on track. once i finally felt confident to begin dating, i spent lots of time looking for the right girl to settle down with. in may of 2019, i was introduced to a girl through a coworker. when we started dating we had an immediate connection. she is everything i’ve spent time looking for in a girl. i took it much slower with her than i ever did with other girls that i have met and ever since we started dating i have never felt happier in my life. there is one moment however when we were together that i can instantly remember thinking to myself “this is the one.” 

we were driving back from a 3 night camping trip that we went on. we were two hours away from our destination and it was the moment i looked at her i couldnt control myself and word vomitted “im madly in love with you woman”. i’ve never felt so uncontrolled or vulnerable, however i also felt relieved and overjoyed that i said it. she was hugging her travel pillow she brings and was looking at me and when i caught her staring at me her face went immediately red and she hid half of it behind her pillow. leaving nothing but a tomato with beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair behind it. i remember thinking how cute it was that she was embarrassed for looking at me the way she did. that moment alone was enough to confirm that this is a girl i want to spend the rest of my life with.",man of reddit what be your much memorable moment of fall in love with someone i be 22 year old and i have be in two serious relationship in my lifetime the ﻿1 relationship i be in be with a girl who i date for six month in the same city and nine month across the world she move to australia with her entire family and we both want to try to make it work since we be both young 18 19 and naive enough to think it would have work out i be in love with her but understand the complication of be in a relationship like that after i have not physically be with her for 8 month i travel to australia and spend a month with her and her family when i return back to the good old great white north the pressure of the long distance relationship begin to set in and 2 week after i get back i pull the trigger and end our relationship it may seem harsh but it be the well option for both of us since she be go to university down there and i be work and try to save money so i can go to school we break up 3 year ago and i spend 2 of that year try to get over her i move to a different city 6 hour away from my hometown try to reset and get a fresh start on life i haven t be with another girl since i move away i be single for 2 5 year try to get myself back on track once i finally feel confident to begin date i spend lot of time look for the right girl to settle down with in may of 2019 i be introduce to a girl through a coworker when we start date we have a immediate connection she be everything i have spend time look for in a girl i take it much slow with her than i ever do with other girl that i have meet and ever since we start date i have never feel happy in my life there be one moment however when we be together that i can instantly remember think to myself this be the one we be drive back from a 3 night camp trip that we go on we be two hour away from our destination and it be the moment i look at her i could not control myself and word vomitted -PRON- be madly in love with you woman i have never feel so uncontrolled or vulnerable however i also feel relieve and overjoyed that i say it she be hug her travel pillow she bring and be look at me and when i catch her stare at me her face go immediately red and she hide half of it behind her pillow leave nothing but a tomato with beautiful blue eye and blonde hair behind it i remember think how cute it be that she be embarrass for look at me the way she do that moment alone be enough to confirm that this be a girl i want to spend the rest of my life with,0

""yeah i can drive i responded, to which she says "" okay i'll be home in about an hour.

267,AskMen,"how can i (22f) learn the basics about how a car works? i wanted to charge my phone so i went to my car and charged it but after 20 minutes, my car started twitching and it stopped running. 

literally had no clue what happened or any clue of what to do. i called my dad and then called the campus police, because what do i do in this situation? 

any who, the campus police department told me to “pop my hood” so that when someone did come looking, they’d be able to find me. i uhh ... didn’t know how to do that. didn’t know what button to press, how to lift the hood, how to keep the hood up, etc. i called my dad for that too, and he had to describe the location for everything. it was more challenging than it should have been. 

i explained myself to the police officer when he came and he like totally understood and he was like, “there was a young woman just like you yesterday in the same situation. here, come around! let me teach you some stuff about the car and like how to hook up the cables in case this happens to one of your girlfriends”. he jumped the car, taught me a thing or two about the battery and sent me on my way. 

reflection: 
- i learned today that i don’t know anything about a car other than how to drive it.

- i don’t know what any of the funky signs on the dashboard mean. 

- i don’t know the basic anatomy of the car. i don’t know what car maintenance entails (the officer noted that my battery had corroded and that it was worth cleaning and that i should replace the lights that illuminate the license plate). my dad takes care of these things. i don’t really know basic car maintenance.

271,AskMen,"men of reddit, how do you sympathise/comfort your partner when they are upset over (minor?) issues i said minor issues but it's hard to catagorize. two examples i can provide though:  

  

1: she felt fat one day and couldn't decide what to wear, she got upset because i didn't comfort her.  

  

2: she felt embarrassed about brushing into a tree while driving over to pick me up (nothing happened to car), she got upset because i stayed silent and didn't comfort her.   


my ""attempts"" of comforting:   
  

1. i said she'll look good in anything she wears and i do genuinely believe that and have said that numerous times. i told her it's hard to comfort her in that situation since it's a self esteem situation (she's not fat or underweight but does have an eating disorder).  
  

2. i thanked her for driving me, but throughout the drive she had a really annoyed face not towards me but it happens everytime there's a inconvenience. she said i was being stoic and she wanted to be comforted.  


i have asked her how she would like to be comforted but she doesn't want to give me an answer because then she's just telling me what to do. she also said she's never had this issue with previous boyfriend which hurt a little since its my first relationship.  

i understand my replies are not what she'd expect and i believe it's a personality difference but i'd like to be more accommodating. growing up i was never comforted much, if i cried my parents would say something like: ""i'll really give you something to cry about"". i don't think i'm emotionaless but it'll take a lot to be affected. a minor inconvenience to my gf would be nothing to me. but that's not why i'm here, i apologise for the long context but i'd like some advice on how to confront a partner when she's angry/frustrated/upset. it's not so much about wanting me to listen and be there but rather the opposite, she wants me to do something and cheer her up. thank you all.",man of reddit how do you sympathise comfort your partner when they be upset over minor issue i say minor issue but -PRON- have hard to catagorize two example i can provide though 1 she feel fat one day and could not decide what to wear she get upset because i do not comfort her 2 she feel embarrass about brush into a tree while drive over to pick me up nothing happen to car she get upset because i stay silent and do not comfort her my attempt of comfort 1 i say -PRON- will look good in anything she wear and i do genuinely believe that and have say that numerous time i tell her -PRON- have hard to comfort her in that situation since -PRON- have a self esteem situation -PRON- have not fat or underweight but doe have a eat disorder 2 i thank her for drive me but throughout the drive she have a really annoy face not towards me but it happen everytime there have a inconvenience she say i be be stoic and she want to be comfort i have ask her how she would like to be comfort but she do not want to give me a answer because then -PRON- have just tell me what to do she also say -PRON- have never have this issue with previous boyfriend which hurt a little since its my ﻿1 relationship i understand my reply be not what -PRON- would expect and i believe -PRON- have a personality difference but -PRON- would like to be much accommodate grow up i be never comfort much if i cry my parent would say something like -PRON- will really give you something to cry about i do not think -PRON- be emotionaless but -PRON- will take a lot to be affect a minor inconvenience to my gf would be nothing to me but that have not why -PRON- be here i apologise for the long context but -PRON- would like some advice on how to confront a partner when -PRON- have angry frustrate upset -PRON- have not so much about want me to listen and be there but rather the opposite she want me to do something and cheer her up thank you all,0

so i asked out my work friends' sister (who also works with us but i rarely saw her as we work different days/hours) out 2 days ago but we are both in school i just finished my last midterm but she has both her midterms this week + work so we decided to go on our date this monday coming up.  we were kinda friends, me mainly with her brother and i would see her here and there.  

about a month ago, after hanging out in a party and us getting more personal, i decided to start talking to her more by snapchat.  then 2 days ago i decided to  ask her out and she said yes.  after the whole planning, we both agreed on monday but what i'm seeing is that she does sound very exited for the date, but she rarely texts me first (even when we were just talking here and there she rarely texted me first) , i know she is probably busy studying for her midterms at the moment, i usually start the conversation and she always replies and what not but i don't know what to think.

however, 2.5 years ago i got a panic attack. it ruined me, a year ago i stopped having attacks and only suffer with negative ocd thoughts due to my anxiety. i have developed a bit of a positive mindset but i still suffer from ocd thoughts. my ocd thoughts are “am i feeling suicidal” but the more i have been thinking about it, not judging it and have noticed that the thought is invalid. i’m not suicidal, i’m confused about life and whether i’ll ever succeed. but i’ve made these ocd thoughts a habit – 21 days makes a habit. i have been trying my best to ignore these thoughts but it’s really hard sometimes. my therapist, friends and family have said i’m normal and i have actually changed in a positive way mentally and physically since last year. 

i have started working out 6 x a week, picked up playing basketball and made several friends which i got somewhat close to. i have been meditating a bit more regularly each day. 10-15 mins but trying to get to 20-30. journal a bit here and there. cut out all junk food and play video games or watch tv once a week for 1-2 hours. i have been reading more self-help books instead of wanting to play video games – which i used to do for 12+ hours a day until 4am and wake up at 12pm. 

i want to fix my sleep schedule, study more and start running but i just feel overwhelmed. i really want to be successful and have a happier life with my family and girlfriend. but i just don’t know how.

687,AskMen,"about meetup mingle, single, mixer, types of meetup. what do you guys think about them? talking about meetup.com

if you have gone to meetup for a while, at least in larger cities, you find that there are these [age bracket], singles, professionals, or mixer type of meetups that are usually combined groups from like 6+ meetup groups and maybe more.  they end up with like 50 to 150 gathered up.  

i've been to very few over several years as i usually went to board games, hiking, and things like that.

it would be nice to meet more potential friends or dates and at first, these huge gatherings seemed nice for that.

but while it could be just me, i find that just seeing so many people, i mean i get nervous with just one person and i'm quite introverted as well.  

either way, i still try my best.  i end up small talking with several people, get to know them a bit and such.  day ends with just going home and that's it.  feel like not much came out of it besides some small talk practice.  did i miss some social gathering class?  are you supposed to ask for people's numbers or something?

it just seems like one meetup, doesnt feel like it's enough to get to know someone.  those meetups aren't that very regular it seems and very unlikely to see the same person.

i find it strange like, i get everyone is probably nervous too.  most ppl looked rather awkward, looking like they want to talk to someone yet like they don't want to the same time.

i just find these meetups a bit weird, like they always have such large gatherings, but it usually feels very lonely in a way.

689,AskMen,"when life has you down, what are ways you keep yourself going? im a 25 yr old dude still really trying to figure myself out and i'm going through a bit of a rough stretch. several months ago i found out someone in my family whom i am really close with has been struggling with a severe drug addiction. in the months since it has really taken a toll on me
 i stopped giving my relationship attention because all of my mental bandwidth has been occupied trying to help my family member and think of ways i can be there for him.  my relationship ultimately ended about a month ago, and left me pretty broken. i've gotten a bit better but i'm still not all there. i tend to be really closed off emotionally because of some childhood trauma,  but i am really trying to be more open with myself and with others. my relationship was the very first time in my life i can say i let myself fall for someone, i loved that i could just be myself around her and she completely accepted me for who i am. after we broke up, i got absolutely furious with myself for not making more of an effort to spend time with her, and just being emotionally present in general. so with all this being said, i'm just curious what others do to clear your mind and get your head back on straight.

i know the obvious, more general answers are going to the gym and picking up a hobby. i've done these two things, i recently got a gym membership and a camera to pick up photography. i do think these help and have made an impact on my mental health, but i dont think its enough (at least not yet). i guess i'd like to know what makes you happy specifically, to give myself more ideas to try and see if i would take an interest in whatever it is as well.

842,AskMen,"men who have significant others, how do you control your wandering eye in public when you see other attractive people? my boyfriend tends look and it makes me upset i don’t think he stares at them but looks. but other women look at him while i’m there with him and it makes me feel like they don’t give a shit i’m with him. it feels disrespectful, but even more so when he looks back at them. i can’t go out anywhere with him because of this simple reason. it boils my blood. saw a girl staring at him from feet away and i noticed him looking at her up and down. i told him we needed to leave the mall immediately, but he kept denying that he did that. one day my friend facetimed me and i asked him if he wanted to say hi to her. she looked really pretty, he make up and hair done. when i showed him his voice kinda stumbled and he said hello but in the weirdest, stern of ways. as if he wanted to impress her. clearly he found her attractive. he always tells me he loves me and all that and i know the world isn’t perfect and he will only find me attractive. but he’s done this multiple times. one time at olive garden a waitress was checking tables and i noticed him looking at her. he cracked his knuckles and later on i brought it up. he said “i find you more attractive.” i told him you don’t see me giving other men googly eyes! my boyfriend has a history of experimenting with at least one guy. i’m convinced he’s bisexual but he also denies that. one day we went out to eat at this mexican restaurant and a man walked by. he looked at him up and down. and guess what, i was livid. more so because it sunk in that not only do i have to be concerned about other women, but other men as well. basically i just don’t ever want to go out anywhere with him. too many little things piss me off and i try try try to control it but i can’t. i want him to just pursue someone else up to this point. he’s a nice guy, but things like this drive me insane and i don’t know how to not overthink it. i can’t even imagine what goes on when i’m not there. do you guys do it too? do you not think about how your significant other is standing or sitting right there next to you??

edit: i think a lot stems from the fact that he was extremely heartbroken when he met me. i felt like i had to put the pieces back together, but for 2 years that he wasn’t over this girl i teared myself down feeling like i was just second best and asking myself why aren’t i good enough for him to be over her already.",man who have significant other how do you control your wander eye in public when you see other attractive people my boyfriend tend look and it make me upset i don t think he stare at them but look but other woman look at him while i be there with him and it make me feel like they don t give a shit i be with him it feel disrespectful but even much so when he look back at them i can t go out anywhere with him because of this simple reason it boil my blood see a girl stare at him from foot away and i notice him look at her up and down i tell him we need to leave the mall immediately but he keep deny that he do that one day my friend facetimed me and i ask him if he want to say hello to her she look really pretty he make up and hair do when i show him his voice kinda stumble and he say hello but in the weird stern of way a if he want to impress her clearly he find her attractive he always tell me he love me and all that and i know the world isn t perfect and he will only find me attractive but he s do this multiple time one time at olive garden a waitress be check table and i notice him look at her he crack his knuckle and late on i bring it up he say i find you much attractive i tell him you don t see me give other man googly eye my boyfriend have a history of experiment with at little one guy i be convince he s bisexual but he also deny that one day we go out to eat at this mexican restaurant and a man walk by he look at him up and down and guess what i be livid much so because it sink in that not only do i have to be concern about other woman but other man a good basically i just don t ever want to go out anywhere with him too many little thing piss me off and i try try try to control it but i can t i want him to just pursue someone else up to this point he s a nice guy but thing like this drive me insane and i don t know how to not overthink it i can t even imagine what go on when i be not there do you guy do it too do you not think about how your significant other be stand or sit right there next to you edit i think a lot stem from the fact that he be extremely heartbroken when he meet me i feel like i have to put the piece back together but for 2 year that he wasn t over this girl i teared myself down feel like i be just 2 well and ask myself why aren t i good enough for him to be over her already,0

679,AskWomen,"how do most working mom's cope and balance around household chores and taking care kids? i really dont mean to be offensive as i come from a drastically different culture compared to the west, where people don't marry someone they love, but marry someone of their caste/group, as a result enforcing traditional gender roles.

most children are worked to death by their parents to study, but in the case of many women here, they're forced to dump off their academic achievements and take care of a kid/kids, and marry as soon as 22-28 to someone they havent met, or if they are lucky, to someone they talk with for 5-10 minutes in front of both party's parent. 

&amp;#x200b;

the reason i mention all this is because i don't want to come off as offensive, since i also grew up in such a household and society, which as result leaves me completely oblivious to the happenings in other societies.

&amp;#x200b;

about 35% of indian women work, and most of them cope with kids, who are treated as a milestone to have. this is how it goes for indian women . 

when will you get high marks &gt; when will you get educated in college   so you can marry &gt; when will you marry &gt; when will you have kids &gt; when will you impose said cycle on your child as well

&amp;#x200b;

as a result, many parents have kids, only because of societal pressure, but women get the short end of the stick, as men go off to work and dont do much work when they get home.

&amp;#x200b;

i asked my friends about it and they all say "" who will take care of kids if both work, how will kids live most of their lives never seeing their parents half the time?"" ""why should the father cook if they come home at evenings all tired, if the kids go off to school, and the mother just prepares food and cleans food?"" "" my father is bad at cooking so its better my mom cooks""

&amp;#x200b;

in such a situation where having kids is pretty much a necessity in society, what should be done actually? should the father be made to cook as well or should he ""rest"" like my friends say?

&amp;#x200b;

how would one cope in such society? genuinely curious. i believe 2 people working can lead to incredibly high living standards, but then questions like this leave me confused",how do much work mom have cope and balance around household chore and take care kid i really do not mean to be offensive a i come from a drastically different culture compare to the west where people do not marry someone they love but marry someone of their caste group a a result enforce traditional gender role much child be work to death by their parent to study but in the case of many woman here -PRON- be force to dump off their academic achievement and take care of a kid kid and marry a soon a 22 28 to someone they have not meet or if they be lucky to someone they talk with for 5 10 minute in front of both party have parent amp x200b the reason i mention all this be because i do not want to come off a offensive since i also grow up in such a household and society which a result leave me completely oblivious to the happening in other society amp x200b about 35 of indian woman work and much of them cope with kid who be treat a a milestone to have this be how it go for indian woman when will you get high mark gt when will you get educate in college so you can marry gt when will you marry gt when will you have kid gt when will you impose say cycle on your child a good amp x200b a a result many parent have kid only because of societal pressure but woman get the short end of the stick a man go off to work and do not do much work when they get home amp x200b i ask my friend about it and they all say who will take care of kid if both work how will kid live much of their live never see their parent half the time why should the father cook if they come home at evening all tire if the kid go off to school and the mother just prepare food and clean food my father be bad at cook so its well my mom cook amp x200b in such a situation where have kid be pretty much a necessity in society what should be do actually should the father be make to cook a good or should he rest like my friend say amp x200b how would one cope in such society genuinely curious i believe 2 people work can lead to incredibly high live standard but then question like this leave me confuse,1

696,AskWomen,"what do you think of these handmaid's tale themed wedding photos? offensive? **tl;dr first** \---  given that it is a work of fiction, do you think it's wrong or offensive or problematic to stage handmaid's tale themed wedding photos; or to otherwise mimic the themes and imagery and characters from the handmaid's tale novel (or tv show), such as dressing up as a handmaid, or throwing a handmaid's tale themed party, for example? 

i was just reading [this article](https://www.blogto.com/arts/2019/10/someone-had-handmaids-tale-themed-wedding-near-toronto-and-people-are-confused/) about a couple who took handmaid's tale themed wedding photos.  the photographer posted them online and it caused quite a stir.  some commenters online seemed to be genuinely offended or angered by the photos and others were making comments about white privilege and feminism.

the author of handmaid's tale, margaret atwood, has said that the novel is a work of speculative **fiction**, although she also states that most or all of the scenarios presented in the work have happened in real life in the course of history.

while it's certainly a bizarre choice of theme for wedding photos, given the dark, disturbing and dystopic nature of the novel, do you think that what this couple did is problematic and/or offensive and/or insensitive to women and survivors etc? 

to extrapolate further on the question.... what about if someone were to dress as one of atwood's fictional handmaid characters for halloween?  what if i as a man were to dress as a handmaid for halloween?   (by no means am i planning on doing that!  but just asking for the sake of discussion)

of course, in the novel, the protagonists - the handmaids - are subjected to horiffic abuse and cruelty and the novel can be strikingly reminiscent of real life events and historical violence towards and oppression of women.  and many people applaud the work for its very strong and inspiring female characters.  so there is obviously a good amount of cross over from this work of fiction into real life emotions and events.

but at the end of the day it is still fiction.   so, what do you think?  is it offensive to mimic or satirize or lampoon the handmaid's tale or its characters?  or to dress up in costume as a handmaid or take themed photographs inspired by it. especially if you are a big fan of the novel (or the tv show) ?",what do you think of this handmaid have tale themed wed photo offensive tl dr ﻿1 give that it be a work of fiction do you think -PRON- have wrong or offensive or problematic to stage handmaid have tale themed wed photo or to otherwise mimic the theme and imagery and character from the handmaid have tale novel or tv show such a dress up a a handmaid or throw a handmaid have tale themed party for example i be just read this article https www blogto com art 2019 10 someone have handmaids tale themed wed near toronto and people be confuse about a couple who take handmaid have tale themed wed photo the photographer post them online and it cause quite a stir some commenters online seem to be genuinely offend or anger by the photo and other be make comment about white privilege and feminism the author of handmaid have tale margaret atwood have say that the novel be a work of speculative fiction although she also state that much or all of the scenario present in the work have happen in real life in the course of history while -PRON- have certainly a bizarre choice of theme for wed photo give the dark disturb and dystopic nature of the novel do you think that what this couple do be problematic and or offensive and or insensitive to woman and survivor etc to extrapolate far on the question what about if someone be to dress a one of atwood have fictional handmaid character for halloween what if i a a man be to dress a a handmaid for halloween by no mean be i plan on do that but just ask for the sake of discussion of course in the novel the protagonist the handmaids be subject to horiffic abuse and cruelty and the novel can be strikingly reminiscent of real life event and historical violence towards and oppression of woman and many people applaud the work for its very strong and inspire female character so there be obviously a good amount of cross over from this work of fiction into real life emotion and event but at the end of the day it be still fiction so what do you think be it offensive to mimic or satirize or lampoon the handmaid have tale or its character or to dress up in costume a a handmaid or take themed photograph inspire by it especially if you be a big fan of the novel or the tv show,1

is it a desire to communicate how you are feeling and essentially give feedback without saying it without words or do you just feel an urge to make some noise? do you want other people to know you're having sex? i'm so curious and i would love to have some insight into the psychology behind it.

943,AskWomen,"how have you brought awareness to, managed or divided emotional work/labour in your long-term relationships?  it's increasingly well known that women do a lot of unpaid/unrecognized work in maintaining households/families/relationships.
