You hear a lot of jokes about inattentive husbands who just genuinely don't think about romance. My dad is like this with my mom but I have no doubt that he loves her and sometimes when she complains about not going on dates or not ever getting surprises from him, he's genuinely shocked. 

But then I also see a lot recently about how men will change for who they want to, so if you notice a lack of effort in a partner, it's probably because he doesn't love you. 

I find this hard to reconcile because I know for a fact that my ex was a lazy dude (due to his nature and a struggle with depression) in all aspects of life, so it's not inconceivable that that just naturally extended into our relationship irrespective of how he felt about me. It's not hard to believe that a guy who won't do his laundry and doesn't go above the minimum at his job would also not set up a romantic date night.

So I was wondering if anyone here had good advice for dealing with the aftermath of an emotionally abusive relationship?

It ended a couple of months ago but I still get really awful feelings (slight nerves, feeling embarrassed or upset, a weird feeling that is kinda like needing to throw up, sometimes showing up in dreams, some other stuff too) every once in a while whenever something reminds me of her. I also do not miss her and would NEVER get back with her. I have unfriended her on everything.

Background:
I was in a 2 year relationship that ended almost 4 months ago. Start of the relationship was great but the last 6 months of it were really bad. We also lived together for 1 year. I am an immigrant to my ex-gf's native country.

The abuse was minor to moderate and never escalated to full on physical abuse. Examples include:
-&gt; never giving me any affection, compliments, etc. and rejecting all of my advances 
-&gt; never wanting to do any of my date ideas and only hers
-&gt; organizing her own things and telling me that I wouldn't be interested so to not bother going with her
-&gt; being pretty distant and grumpy at home and way more upbeat when we did do something together with her friends
-&gt; talking about her sexual experiences with her previous partners in public whilst nothing was going on between us (even after I told her how this upset me. Of course it was my fault for being upset...)
-&gt; downplaying how poorly my people were treated in history because it wasn't as bad as some groups in her country 
-&gt; always telling me everything was fine when I asked if the relationship was ok, which made me feel bad for questioning things (even up to just before the relationship ended).  
-&gt; Lying to me about wanting to move out to be closer to school and we could do long distance. She kept that up until the day it ended. She broke the news when she only had one car load of her stuff left to do. Told me for a while how we could do long distance as I planned on getting a licence, car, and planned out days to meet.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this is not the appropriate place to post a question like this, or if this triggers anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

Context:

I (F27, Indian) have been casually seeing a guy (M27, White)  for the past month. We meet at either his place or mine, have pleasant small talk, have sex, and cuddle multiple times a week . Things have been great so far, except that the guy prefers that I keep my clothes on during sex (apart from removing what needs to be removed), and I'm slightly uncomfortable with it. He is agnostic towards his own clothes, and I strongly prefer not having clothes on. It is such an intimate thing after all. It is unusual for me as all guys I've been with like the girl to at least be partially undressed.

The reason it bothers me is because a previous guy I dated wanted to call it off with me because I wasn't ""petite"" enough for him (I'm 5'5"", 140 pounds). Before that, I was very comfortable in my skin, I believed I looked sexy when I wanted to, and was overall satisfied with my body and my sex life. But the previous guy's comments has made me a little less secure about my body. I know that every person has their own preference, and I'm neither judging the previous guy for wanting to be with petite women, or feeling that I'm completely worthless, but it does make me question whether this guy also doesn't want to see me naked because he thinks I'm unattractive. I haven't asked him yet if it is just me, or he generally has a preference for clothes-on with other women as well. It can't be hygiene issues as I shower, put lotion and dress nice everytime I meet him. If the reason is that he doesn't find my body attractive, I'd rather call it off than be with someone who'd only want to have sex with me with clothes on. Hence the question.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - Assuming that most guys prefer the girl to be at least partially undressed during sex, under what situations would you prefer that the girl keeps her clothes on, in a casual FWB relationship?&lt;/p&gt;

So, I used to be a pretty heavy porn user back in college, like, 10 years ago.

Most of it was normal porn but some of it was slightly weird, like, sometimes I would watch those “super heroine gets defeated and fu\*\*ed” videos...

Anyway, I was generally able to carry on with life as normal and passed college, and was still a very normal person in my real life, had lots of friends, but still slightly introverted.

I’m 30 now, and about 5 years ago, I discovered the NoFap and NoPorn communities, and started reading about all the “damaging” effects of porn use, such as causing social anxiety, lack of confidence, etc.

After reading all the success stories from reformed porn users I got really excited and totally cut porn out of my life, and minimised fapping to once or twice a month.

I honestly did start noticing myself becoming more confident, assertive and outgoing, and naturally being more drawn to real life girls. Holding eye contact became a lot easier.

Now, 5 years later I’m still using porn as infrequently as possible, but occasionally I will “relapse” and binge on it for a few hours. This happens maybe once every 4 months or so.

Whenever it happens, I really beat myself up, I think mostly because people on those subreddits say that it causes social anxiety/low self esteem to come back.

I just “relapsed” for the first time in 2019 yesterday (Yes I went 10 months without porn), and now I’m terrified that when I go into my sales job on Monday that I’ll be really bad at it, since it requires one to be super outgoing, charming and assertive.

Clearly, I’m not addicted to porn use, and can easily go months without using it. But the people on the NoPorn subs have convinced me that it takes a couple of weeks of no porn to get the “superpowers” back.

It has to be placebo, as lots of my friends look at porn all the time and then just go about their lives as usual, and lots of them are very loud and confident, “life of the party” types.

I guess I’m looking for some reassurance here that occasional porn use isn’t a bad thing, and that everyone has their kind of weird little fetishes, and that it doesn’t matter as long as you don’t carry them into real life. (I’ve had girlfriends and my sex life with them is totally normal, never wanted to do any weird stuff)

For the past few years, every time I relapse I purposely try to avoid parties, social events, etc for 2 weeks or so, until the “superpowers” gained from abstaining come back.

We got along fine and she if pretty nice so thats not an issue. My issue is after I hug my brother, how do I greet his girl? Do I even go in for physical contact? The first time I met her I shook her hand and that seemed normal. But now, I know her, but I don't know if it would be awkward to go in for a hug? 

What I'm thinking I do is not even go in for physical contact. Just a ""hey whatsup? hows life"". And if she goes for the hug, I'll reciprocate. 

Wow, after writing this I know I am overthinking this, but it is something that always gets me so I thought I might as well as you guys and I think this is a good sub for it.

The first relationship I was in was with a girl who I dated for six months in the same city, and nine months across the world. She moved to Australia with her entire family and we both wanted to try to make it work since we were both young (18/19) and naive enough to think it would have worked out. I WAS in love with her but understood the complications of being in a relationship like that. After I hadnt physically been with her for 8 months, I travelled to Australia and spent a month with her and her family. When I returned back to the good ol’ great white north, the pressure of the long distance relationship began to set in and 2 weeks after I got back I pulled the trigger and ended our relationship. It may seem harsh but it was the best option for both of us since she was going to university down there and I was working and trying to save money so I could go to school. We broke up 3 years ago and I spent 2 of those years trying to get over her. I moved to a different city 6 hours away from my hometown trying to reset and get a fresh start on life.

I haven’t been with another girl since I moved away, I was single for 2.5 years trying to get myself back on track. Once I finally felt confident to begin dating, I spent lots of time looking for the right girl to settle down with. In May of 2019, I was introduced to a girl through a coworker. When we started dating we had an immediate connection. She is everything I’ve spent time looking for in a girl. I took it much slower with her than I ever did with other girls that I have met and ever since we started dating I have never felt happier in my life. There is ONE moment however when we were together that I can instantly remember thinking to myself “This is the one.” 

We were driving back from a 3 night camping trip that we went on. We were two hours away from our destination and it was the moment I looked at her I couldnt control myself and word vomitted “IM MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU WOMAN”. I’ve never felt so uncontrolled or vulnerable, however I also felt relieved and overjoyed that I said it. She was hugging her travel pillow she brings and was looking at me and when I caught her staring at me her face went immediately red and she hid half of it behind her pillow. Leaving nothing but a tomato with beautiful blue eyes and blonde hair behind it. I remember thinking how cute it was that she was embarrassed for looking at me the way she did.

1: she felt fat one day and couldn't decide what to wear, she got upset because I didn't comfort her.  

  

2: she felt embarrassed about brushing into a tree while driving over to pick me up (nothing happened to car), she got upset because I stayed silent and didn't comfort her.   


My ""attempts"" of comforting:   
  

1. I said she'll look good in anything she wears and I do genuinely believe that and have said that numerous times. I told her it's hard to comfort her in that situation since it's a self esteem situation (she's not fat or underweight but does have an eating disorder).  
  

2. I thanked her for driving me, but throughout the drive she had a really annoyed face not towards me but it happens everytime there's a inconvenience. She said I was being stoic and she wanted to be comforted.  


I have asked her how she would like to be comforted but she doesn't want to give me an answer because then she's just telling me what to do. She also said she's never had this issue with previous boyfriend which hurt a little since its my first relationship.  

I understand my replies are not what she'd expect and I believe it's a personality difference but I'd like to be more accommodating. Growing up I was never comforted much, if I cried my parents would say something like: ""I'll really give you something to cry about"".

I am in a relationship with a girl I like for almost one year now. She's good in every aspect and I really can't find one bad thing to say about her. My problem is with my lizard brain, that gets turned on every time I go out with some friends into some bar or any other event where lots of ladies will be present. I get that impulse that takes hold of me and then I want to flirt, I start thinking this one looks really pretty, I wonder what it would be to fuck with this one, and I feel like shit because I realize that I want to be single again.

I have been for most of my life single, until 28 to be exact. So for most of my life, I was going out having this freedom to act on my impulses, but now it's really like being hungry and fighting against my instincts. It feels hard, I don't want to hurt my partner but at the same time it feels like giving up on something that is me. I really crave that lust when I am out with friends, drinking, music around and ladies everywhere...

Should it be like this when I am in a relationship ? Is it possible to just fight it for a while, and the impulse will eventually fade away with time ?  How do you guys deal with this ?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, so here&amp;#39;s my inner conflict and I am sure this is really common. I am in a relationship with a girl I like for almost one year now. She&amp;#39;s good in every aspect and I really can&amp;#39;t find one bad thing to say about her. My problem is with my lizard brain, that gets turned on every time I go out with some friends into some bar or any other event where lots of ladies will be present. I get that impulse that takes hold of me and then I want to flirt, I start thinking this one looks really pretty, I wonder what it would be to fuck with this one, and I feel like shit because I realize that I want to be single again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been for most of my life single, until 28 to be exact. So for most of my life, I was going out having this freedom to act on my impulses, but now it&amp;#39;s really like being hungry and fighting against my instincts. It feels hard, I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt my partner but at the same time it feels like giving up on something that is me. I really crave that lust when I am out with friends, drinking, music around and ladies everywhere...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should it be like this when I am in a relationship ? Is it possible to just fight it for a while, and the impulse will eventually fade away with time ?  How do you guys deal with this ?&lt;/p&gt;

If you guys have any advise to get back in shape with routines or workout plans or whatever it is it will be amazing! Sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;

So i asked out my work friends' sister (who also works with us but i rarely saw her as we work different days/hours) out 2 days ago but we are both in school i just finished my last midterm but she has both her midterms this week + work so we decided to go on our date this Monday coming up.  We were kinda friends, me mainly with her brother and i would see her here and there.  

About a month ago, after hanging out in a party and us getting more personal, i decided to start talking to her more by snapchat.  Then 2 days ago i decided to  ask her out and she said yes.  After the whole planning, we both agreed on Monday but what i'm seeing is that she does sound very exited for the date, but she rarely texts me first (even when we were just talking here and there she rarely texted me first) , i know she is probably busy studying for her midterms at the moment, i usually start the conversation and she always replies and what not but i don't know what to think.  

Should i be texting her often to show interest? or should i back off a little and just text when it gets closer to our date?  I don't know how to act since i've never gone out with a person that i'm already kind of friends with.  

Would love your input and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

&lt;p&gt;So i asked out my work friends&amp;#39; sister (who also works with us but i rarely saw her as we work different days/hours) out 2 days ago but we are both in school i just finished my last midterm but she has both her midterms this week + work so we decided to go on our date this Monday coming up.  We were kinda friends, me mainly with her brother and i would see her here and there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, after hanging out in a party and us getting more personal, i decided to start talking to her more by snapchat.  Then 2 days ago i decided to  ask her out and she said yes.  After the whole planning, we both agreed on Monday but what i&amp;#39;m seeing is that she does sound very exited for the date, but she rarely texts me first (even when we were just talking here and there she rarely texted me first) , i know she is probably busy studying for her midterms at the moment, i usually start the conversation and she always replies and what not but i don&amp;#39;t know what to think.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should i be texting her often to show interest? or should i back off a little and just text when it gets closer to our date?  I don&amp;#39;t know how to act since i&amp;#39;ve never gone out with a person that i&amp;#39;m already kind of friends with.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would love your input and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

At 215 pounds,  There was a kid who stood out like a sore thumb from the rest. He already had cauliflower ear  And had a head like a fucking toaster. He was 1st on the scale at his weight and was .3 pounds over. His coach ask him if he can piss, Gave him gum and told him to start spitting and put him on a bicycle. You only have until the end of your weight class to make weight and so the guy only had a few minutes to lose .3 pounds.  Meanwhile his coach is whispering in a teammate's ear and calls the big kid back over. As he walks up his teammate rares back and strokes this kid in the nose and blood went everywhere. As the 215 started after his teammate to whip his ass...the coach grabbed ahold of him told him to calm down and go bleed in the sink. The kid made weight by bleeding off blood.

However, 2.5 years ago I got a panic attack. It ruined me, a year ago I stopped having attacks and only suffer with negative OCD thoughts due to my anxiety. I have developed a bit of a positive mindset but I still suffer from OCD thoughts. My OCD thoughts are “am I feeling suicidal” but the more I have been thinking about it, not judging it and have noticed that the thought is invalid. I’m not suicidal, I’m confused about life and whether I’ll ever succeed. But I’ve made these OCD thoughts a habit – 21 days makes a habit. I have been trying my best to ignore these thoughts but it’s really hard sometimes. My therapist, friends and family have said I’m normal and I have actually changed in a positive way mentally and physically since last year. 

I have started working out 6 x a week, picked up playing basketball and made several friends which I got somewhat close to. I have been meditating a bit more regularly each day. 10-15 mins but trying to get to 20-30. Journal a bit here and there. Cut out all junk food and play video games or watch tv once a week for 1-2 hours. I have been reading more self-help books instead of wanting to play video games – which I used to do for 12+ hours a day until 4am and wake up at 12pm. 

I want to fix my sleep schedule, study more and start running but I just feel overwhelmed. I really want to be successful and have a happier life with my family and girlfriend. But I just don’t know how.

If you have gone to meetup for a while, at least in larger cities, you find that there are these [age bracket], singles, professionals, or mixer type of meetups that are usually combined groups from like 6+ meetup groups and maybe more.  They end up with like 50 to 150 gathered up.  

I've been to very few over several years as I usually went to board games, hiking, and things like that.

It would be nice to meet more potential friends or dates and at first, these huge gatherings seemed nice for that.

But while it could be just me, I find that just seeing so many people, I mean I get nervous with just one person and I'm quite introverted as well.  

Either way, I still try my best.  I end up small talking with several people, get to know them a bit and such.  Day ends with just going home and that's it.  Feel like not much came out of it besides some small talk practice.  Did I miss some social gathering class?  Are you supposed to ask for people's numbers or something?

It just seems like one meetup, doesnt feel like it's enough to get to know someone.  Those meetups aren't that very regular it seems and very unlikely to see the same person.

I find it strange like, I get everyone is probably nervous too.  Most ppl looked rather awkward, looking like they want to talk to someone yet like they don't want to the same time.

I just find these meetups a bit weird, like they always have such large gatherings, but it usually feels very lonely in a way.

&lt;p&gt;It just seems like one meetup, doesnt feel like it&amp;#39;s enough to get to know someone.  Those meetups aren&amp;#39;t that very regular it seems and very unlikely to see the same person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it strange like, I get everyone is probably nervous too.  Most ppl looked rather awkward, looking like they want to talk to someone yet like they don&amp;#39;t want to the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just find these meetups a bit weird, like they always have such large gatherings, but it usually feels very lonely in a way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your guys thoughts on those type of meetups?&lt;/p&gt;

 I stopped giving my relationship attention because all of my mental bandwidth has been occupied trying to help my family member and think of ways I can be there for him.  My relationship ultimately ended about a month ago, and left me pretty broken. I've gotten a bit better but I'm still not all there. I tend to be really closed off emotionally because of some childhood trauma,  but I am really trying to be more open with myself and with others. My relationship was the very first time in my life I can say I let myself fall for someone, I loved that I could just be myself around her and she completely accepted me for who I am. After we broke up, I got absolutely furious with myself for not making more of an effort to spend time with her, and just being emotionally present in general. So with all this being said, I'm just curious what others do to clear your mind and get your head back on straight.

I know the obvious, more general answers are going to the gym and picking up a hobby. I've done these two things, I recently got a gym membership and a camera to pick up photography. I do think these help and have made an impact on my mental health, but I dont think its enough (at least not yet). I guess I'd like to know what makes you happy specifically, to give myself more ideas to try and see if I would take an interest in whatever it is as well.

We dont want a chain on the door as it is the only exit we have. If something happens to us, or fire or somethinf, the kids cant get out. So thats a big no.

We are looking for some type of little device you put on the door and it sends it to you phone. Im looking for one that would start my alarm, not just a notification.

Theres so many online, im lost, and none are mentioning if its alarm or notification.

Can anyone help me here? Thank you!

Oh also I have planned activities to remove myself and toddler from the house so he can actually rest, but he is still trying to help and do things because I’m 8 months pregnant and my energy is limited.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit men!
